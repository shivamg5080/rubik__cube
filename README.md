# Rubik's Cube Solver - using Korf's IDA* Algorithm
https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos402/papers/korfrubik.pdf (Korf's Research Paper)

Modelled a virtual Rubik's Cube (3 x 3) in 3 different models/classes (3D Array Model, 1D Array Model, BitBoard Model)

• Implemented OPPS concepts like Classes and Objects, Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes, Inheritance, Operator Overloading

• Achieved a solving time of under 3 seconds for a Rubik's Cube jumbled 8 times, using BFS, DFS, and IDDFS algorithms

• Implemented the Korf's IDA* Algorithm, achieving a solving time under 10 seconds for a Rubik's Cube jumbled 13 times.
